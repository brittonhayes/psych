## Installation

### Install with Go

```

### Run with Docker

docker run -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/brittonhayes/psych -- fetch --state <state> --county <county> --zip <zip> --view
```

## Usage

Psych provides a set of commands to perform various tasks. Here's a brief overview:

### Fetch 

Use the `fetch` command to retrieve therapist from the web

```bash
# Retrieve all therapists in the United States in your county
psych fetch --state <state> --county <county>

# Retrieve all therapists in your zip code
psych fetch --zip <zip>

# Retrieve all therapists in your city
psych fetch --city <city> --state <state>
```

Replace `<state>`, `<county>`, `<city>`, and `<zip>` with the desired criteria for searching therapists.

### Browse

Browse therapists in the terminal using the `view` command.

```bash
psych view
```

### GraphQL Playground 

Run a GraphQL playground to query therapist data using the `view -w` command.

```bash
psych view --port <port> -w
```

Example GraphQL query

```graphql
{
  therapists(filter: { credentials: "LMFT" }) {
    title
    accepting_appointments
    credentials
    statement
    link
  }
}
```

Replace `<port>` with the desired port number for the GraphQL server.
